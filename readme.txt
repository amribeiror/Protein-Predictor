Welcome to TopoPRED, a membrane protein topology predictor.

The main script for the predictor (TopoPRED.sh) contains the main commands and **will** be the main script to run the predictor, calling other scripts and requesting users to choose parameters (filepath, window size, PSSM data or not, C-value for SVC, etc) and classifiers (linear VS. kernel, for example). Some of these features are already implemented.

For the purpose of the course, the remaining scrips included in /scripts should also be downloaded in order to run the respective classifier.
